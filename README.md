# Solidity smart contract bug detection repository
A repository for Solidity smart contracts acting as security bug tests for static analysis tools. Currently, there are 13 different tests, 11 of them have security vulnerabilities in them, each with different levels of severity. 

The tests were used with 5 Solidity static analysis tools - namely, Remix IDE static analysis plugin, Slither, Oyente, Mythril and SmartCheck. You are more than welcome to use these tests with other static analysis tools for Solidity smart contracts as well.
